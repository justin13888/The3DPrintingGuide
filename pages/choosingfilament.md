# Choosing the right 3D Printing Material

When choosing materials to use for your application, you should focus on the following:

1. Price
2. Properties and Characteristics
3. Printability

## Price

Your filament price will always be a limiting factor for your application. For example, if you are working on a personal hobby project, you will most likely not afford using PEEK or other costly filaments. On the other hand, filaments such as PLA is much more favourable because of its much more affordable price range.

## Properties and Characteristics

Each filament has different properties and characteristics, like durabilitry, hardness, tensile strength, density, heat conductivity, etc. For example, if you are building a 3D printed drone, you may want to use TPU for absorbing impacts or ABS for the mechanical parts.

## Printability

One of the many reasons why many hobbiests still use PLA as their go-to filament of choice is because printing it can be no harder than really other filaments. In prototyping, you may be able to use PLA to design the right parts quickly with minimal warping and high dimensional accuracy before you print with the ideal but more expensive or hard to print filament for production.

## Conclusion

Like many other things in 3D printing and engineering, your choice of filament boils down to a compromsise. Sometimes, however, deciding on what compromises you want to or are able to make can be difficult. So one suggestion to search around for what others use or inspecting what other past successful projects have used.
