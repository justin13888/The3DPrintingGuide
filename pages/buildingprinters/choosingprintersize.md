# Choosing the Right Printer Size

## Pro's and Con's to a large printer

### Pro's

- Large prints
- Printing multiple smaller parts at the same time

### Con's

- Heavier Y axis due to a larger X axis
- More expensive to scale
  - May require a stiffer frame
  - E.g. 500x500 heated bed may cost three times a 300x300 heated bed.
  - Requires higher tolerance as all small defects can become large
  - Takes up more space
  - Requires larger belts

## Bottom Line

When deciding on the right size of printer, you have to make a compromise between:

1. Size
2. Affordability
3. Speed and Quality

As an idea, you can have two printers: one for small, precise and high quality parts and one for large parts or batches.
