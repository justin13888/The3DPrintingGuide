# Frame

The frame is a structural component of 3D Printers and must withstand the mechanical loads that the motion system generates. It is the foundation of a 3D printer and largely determines its size and structural rigidity. Most printers today use aluminum extrusions although early printers used materials such as laser-cut plywood.
