# Print Surface

The print surface is the surface on top the print bed which extruded filament directly adheres to. For different filament materials, there are different print surfaces that are best.

## Factors

When looking for the correct print surface for your application, there are a number of factors:

- **Adhesion to filament**: Bed adhesion, which is specific to filament, is essential for successful prints.
- **Levelness**: Print beds need to be flat to ensure proper bed adhesion. It should stay relatively thermally stable such that it remains true even under heating.
- **Bottom finish**: While some purely want structural engineering parts, designers, for example, who want a smooth finish at the bottom of the print, will prefer print surfaces such as glass which provides a mirror-like finish.
- **Durability**: Many plastic print surfaces cannot survive numerous heat cycles of expansion and contraction or has an easily damaged surface.
- **Cost**: This is a factor that may not matter as much for commercial applications but one that many hobbyists may consider.
- **Ease of removal**: This factor is dependent on the durability of the print surface and strength of the bed adhesion to the part material(s).
- **Ease of cleanup**: Over time, contaminants such as grease, dust and pieces of old plastic prints result in an uneven and bad-adhering print surface.
- **Heating uniformity**: A heated print bed is usually preferred or necessary for proper bed adhesion. However, certain materials spread heat more uniformly than others.

## Options

### Aluminum PCB

Aluminum beds, usually a cast aluminum plate with a heated PCB below, heats up quickly and allow various bed adhesive sheets or materials to be applied on top. Although some printers come with a purely aluminum bed, most today have some type of bed adhesion sheets or materials.

### Glass

Glass, or more specifically borosilicate glass, is another popular option. While bare glass provides an unbeatable mirror finish on the bottom of prints, adhesive materials from generic glue stick to specialized bed adhesion products are usually required to improve bed adhesion. Alternatively, adhesive stickers or sheets can be applied (see below). Moreover, glass beds are relatively much more level than aluminum beds. They, however, take longer to heat up because of its lower thermal conductivity although it spreads the heat more uniformly.

### PEI (Ultem)

With a heated bed, most materials adhere well to PEI when heated and detaches as it cools. It is a very popular as it is works well for most materials and relatively maintenance-free. It normally does not require any surface adhesives. It has excellent mechanical properties: radiation resistance, high and low-temperature resistance, high temperature stability and wear resistance, good fire retardancy, chemical resistance and electrical insulation.

They are readily available and relatively affordable. They provide good thermal conductivity for heated beds. However, some materials such as PETG may stick too well and TPU and TPE can even strongly bond to the plate. Luckily, glue stick, for example, can be applied before prints to help release parts after prints. For difficult to print filaments such as ABS and Nylon, there are other options that may be preferred for better adhesion. It is also relatively soft and thus can also be damaged with excessive scraping.

### Kapton Tape

Although Kapton tape is commonly used in electronics for thermal insulation, it is also very effective in evenly distributing heat across the bed and adhering difficult filament such as ABS. However, Kapton tape can be damaged during print removal and scraping. Although one roll is usually reasonably priced.

### Garolite

Garolite, glass-fibre cloth impregnated with epoxy resins and cured with high pressure, is one of the least common print surfaces. Interestingly however, filaments such as Nylon, which are notorious for warping due to unheated beds, adhere to Garolite without heat nor PVA glue.

### BuildTak or Similar Adhesive Sheets

Specialized products like BuildTak are adhesive sheets that can be applied to most bed surfaces like aluminum and glass. It is able to adhere to even the most warp-prone filaments such as ABS. Some are also able to be bent to pop prints off the surface.

### Acrylic

Acrylic and some other plastic build plates can be used but is very uncommon. Theoretically, it could work but there are much better alternatives.
