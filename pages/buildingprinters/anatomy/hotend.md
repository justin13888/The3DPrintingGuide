# Hotend

The Hotend, as the name suggests, is part of the 3D printer that heats up and melts the filament being extruded. Today, hotends are generally categorized as either all-metal or PTFE-lined. All metal hotends can normally print at how much higher temperatures than PTFE-lined hotends which are limited to under 240°C as PTFE degrades above it. There are also PEEK-lined hotends which was once an industry norm; but, it has the temperature limitation of PTFE and jams even more often than PTFE and hence is unpreferred and mostly unused anymore.

It generally has the following components:

- Heat sink

There are other miscellaneous parts like a sock that are not essential for the part function so they will not be discussed.

## Specifications

When comparing hot ends, there are a few details to compare:

|       Name        | Description                                                                      |
| :---------------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   Filament size   | Usually either 1.75 mm or 3.00 mm                                                |
|   Construction    | All-metal or PTFE-lined                                                          |
| Temperature Range | Determines which filaments you can print                                         |
|     Flow rate     | Determines how much volume of filament can be extruded in a given time           |
| Number of Nozzles | Although most have one nozzle, some allow more than one in a single heater block |

## Components

### Heat Sink

The heat sink ensures the filament before the heat break stays below the [glass-transition temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_transition#Transition_temperature_Tg) of the filament. Otherwise, semi-solid filament between the glass-transition and melting temperature, known as the Critical Transition Phase, will cause the hotend to seize and jam as it expands and grips the inside of the hotend. It is usually air-cooled by a small part fan although some are water-cooled.

### Heater Block

The heater block thermally conducts the heat generated by the heater cartridge to the nozzle and the filament. It also connects with the temperature sensor which measures the hotend temperature; the heater cartridge which heats up the block and the nozzle which has the orifice that the hot filament extrudes out of.

### Heat Break

The heat break is essentially a small thin tube that connects and is the transition point of the heat sink and heater block. In theory, the thinner and longer the heat break, the better it is as it reduces "heat creep" where the hot heater block transfers heat to the supposedly cool heat sink. Heat breaks are either all-metal or PTFE-lined. This is a key differentiating part between all-metal and PTFE-lined hotend. All-metal heat breaks have a 1.75 mm orifice machined inside for the filament to directly go through while PTFE-lined heat breaks have a larger orifice to allow a PTFE tube in the heat zone and directly meet the nozzle. Moreover, all-metal heat breaks usually have coatings to help the filament slide instead of sticking and jamming.

### Nozzle

The nozzle is at the tip of the hotend where the heated filament extrudes out of. It is threaded into the heater

The nozzle diameter is the size of the orifice, usually ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 mm in diameter. Smaller nozzles are able to print finer details with higher precision but is easier to clog. Larger nozzles can usually reduce print time and is more reliable. The common size is 0.4 mm which provides a good balance between quality and print speed. However, there are also large industrial 3D printers for certain unique applications that may use much larger sizes.

Often, nozzles are made of standard brass which works well for most regular filaments. However, there are other materials like stainless steel and ruby-tipped for more exotic filaments that are abrasive.

Brass nozzles are te most affordable and are good for non-abrasive materials that include:

- PLA
- ABS
- PETG
- Nylon
- TPE/TPU

Stainless steel nozzles are acceptable for light use of abrasive materials while stainless steel and ruby-tipped nozzles are better for longer uses but cost more. Abrasive filaments that require these types of nozzles include:

- NylonX
- Carbon fibre
- Glow-in-the-dark filaments
- Metal filaments
- Wood-filled and ceramic-filled filaments

There are also some nozzles with special coatings that have a similar function but are usually proprietary and much more expensive.

### Heater Cartridge

The heater cartridge, which is essentially a large resistor, heats up the hotend. The power of a cartridge is usually measured by how much power is uses in Watts. Cartridges for 3D printers usually range from 24 W to 50 W although there are other, industrial applications that probably use ones with much higher power or multiple.

### Temperature Sensor

In hotends, there are three main types of temperature sensors used: thermistors, PT100 sensors and thermocouples. In short, thermistors are the most common as they are relatively affordable and work fine for most use cases while PT100 sensors are used and usually preferred over thermistors and thermocouples for printing at temperatures any higher than 300°C.
