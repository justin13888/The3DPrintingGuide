# Calibrating your 3D Printer

<!-- TODO: Specific Instructions for steps -->
Your printer calibration is crucial for optimal performance. The following are the steps in chronological order.

Calibration should be done on a schedule basis or after every part adjustment or upgrade.

If you are unsure on how to do any of the following steps, you may have to find your own answer or request for the missing information to be added. You can also refer to [Informational Links and References](/pages/resources.md).

## General Steps

1. Calibrate E steps.
    - Use a ruler to measure the actual extruded amount versus the requested amount.
2. Calibrate steps for other axes.
    - Print a calibration cube for the X,Y and Z axes.
3. PID autotune the hotend and bed.

## Filament-specific Steps

1. Do a heat tower test for finding the ideal filament temperature.
2. Do retraction tests to find your ideal retraction setting.
3. Calibrate linear advance (a.k.a. pressure advance) for the targetted print speed.
4. Tuning acceleration and junction deviation.
