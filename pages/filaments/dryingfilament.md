# Drying Filament

All FDM/FFF 3D printing filaments are hygroscopic, meaning it absorbs moisture. Wet filament, however, can be problematic when being 3D printed. So proper filament storage is essential for successful prints. But sometimes, filament becomes too moist for use so we have to dry it.

## Identifying Wet Filament

Different filaments have different and varying degrees of signs of being too moist.

The following are common symptoms of wet filament:

- Popping or cracking sounds during extrusion
- Severely weakened part strength and layer adhesion
- Uneven extrusion lines
- Oddly severe stringing, blobbing or oozing
- Weirdly textured or "fuzzy" surfaces on prints

## How to Dry Filament

1. Filament Dryer
   - These are dedicated devices just to dry filament!
2. Oven
   - This is the easiest way to dry filament as every likely has one at home.
   - Set the temperature right below the glass transition temperature of your wet filament and leave it in the oven for 4-6 hours until all moisture evaporates.
3. Food Dehydrator
   - This is another great option besides the oven and the steps are the same.
