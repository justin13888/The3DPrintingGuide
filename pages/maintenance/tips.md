# 3D Printer Maintenance Tips

This is a general guideline for 3D printer maintenance.

## Tips

1. Dust away the surface dust
   - Use a microfibre cloth or paper towel and IPA.
   - Dust is commonly trapped around the V-rollers, linear bearings, linear rails and/or lead screw couplers.
   - Sometimes, dust can build up around the hotend heatsink and the cooling fan.
   - For certain build surfaces like PEI, lightly scuff the surface with IPA and steelwool as well.
2. Tighten the motion system
   - For printers with V-rollers like the Ender 3, make sure the printhead does not wobble and is able to roll smoothly and freely by adjusting with the eccentric nut.
   - For printers with linear bearings and hardenedrods like the Prusas, check for wobble or unsmoothness.
     - Looseness may indicate a worn-out bearing while unsmoothness may be due to a scratched, unsmooth, or untrue rod.
   - Check for belt tension and tighten as necessary, especially for CoreXY.
   - Make sure screws such as the ones connecting the hotend are tight.
3. Lubricate hardened rods, linear rails and lead screws with synthetic grease.
4. Inspect all cables and connectors.
   - Make sure they are secure and tight.
   - Check for burns and discolouration.
   - Check for rubbing, strained or broken cables.
5. Clean the nozzle and hotend.
   - You can either do a cold pull or use cleaning filament.
   - To cold pull, heat the nozzle up to the previously used filament, let it cool below 100Â°C and give the filament a firm pull.
   - For cleaning filament, just push the cleaning filament until the extruded filament is clear of residue or contamination.
6. Make a final overall inspection of all mechanical components of the printer.
7. Update your firmware if it is old. Newer versions may contain bugfixes and new features.
