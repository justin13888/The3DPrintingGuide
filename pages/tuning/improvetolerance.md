# Improving Tolerance

Achieving tight tolerances ensures that parts fit together. Knowing the printer's tolerance allows you to design parts with the proper clearances in mind.

## Testing Tolerance

To test a 3D printer's tolerance, start with some simple calibration cubes or dimensional accuracy tests. Using some calipers, precisely measure the gap. A tolerance of +/-0.1 mm is average for what most printers can get. Many industrial/commercial or "professional desktop" 3D printers can get XY tolerances as close as ~+/-10 microns or 0.01 mm.

## Tuning for Tolerance

There are always ways to improve tolerance but it is a matter of how much resources like time and money you can afford. Nevertheless, there are a few things to first try to improve the tolerance:

- **Inspect the motion system.** Old, worn-down components can negatively affect the printer's accuracy and should be replaced. Loose parts such as belts should be immediately tightened.
- **Use better filament.** The type and brand of filament largely affects your printer tolerance. Some less expensive filament, for example, have worse extrusion defects and are less dimensionally stable when being used.
- [**Calibrate the printer.**](printercalibration.md) Ultimately, a badly calibrated printer will certainly have bad tolerances.
