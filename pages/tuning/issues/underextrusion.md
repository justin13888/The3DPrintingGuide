# Under-Extrusion

Under-extrusion is when there is less filament being extruded than there should be.

## Incorrect or inconsistent filament diameter

**Make sure the slicer is set to the correct filament diameter**. The most common sizes are 1.75 mm and 2.85 mm. You may also want to measure the true diameter of the filament.

## Incorrect extrusion multiplier or flow

Known as "Extrusion Multiplier" or "Flow", **adjust the value**. Different materials tend to have different values. A test cube is ideal for testing or diagnosing under-extrusion.
