# Grinding Filament

Most 3D printers use drive gears to grip and push the filament into the hotend. Sometimes however, instead of gripping the filament, the drive gear grinds or strips the filament instead.

## The retraction speed is too fast

If the retraction speed is too fast or the retraction is too far,  the extruder or filament may stuggle to keep up. Try **reducing the retraction speed** to see if the problem still exists.

## The extruder temperature is too low

Try **increasing the extruder temperature by 5-10 Â°C** which may help the plastic flow easier.

## The print speed is too fast

A faster print speed increases stress on the extruder motor and hob gears. Try **decreasing the print speed**.

## The nozzle is clogged

If increasing the print temperature and decreasing the print speed did not work, it is likely the nozzle is partially clogged. **Refer to [Clogged Extruder](cloggedextruder.md)**.
