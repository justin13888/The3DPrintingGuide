# Clogged Extruder

In a 3D printer, filament is normally extruded through a small orifice known as the nozzle. However, it is possible for some filament or contaminants to clog the nozzle.

## The filament is clogged inside

1. Heat up the hotend and **extrude a small amount of filament while lightly pushing the filament by hand**.
2. Heat up the hotend, quickly retract the filament using the motor or by hand, cutting away the damage or melted portion and **reload the filament**.
3. **Clean out the nozzle**. Some do a cold pull by heating the extruder up to 100Â°C and manually pulling the filament out. You can also try using a needle to push the material backwards; but be aware of the needle snapping in the nozzle. There are many other methods as well so consult the printer or component manufacturer.
