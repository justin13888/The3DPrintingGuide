# Layer Separation

On a 3D print, objects are built layer-by-layer, relying on each layer to properly adhere and bond to the previous layer. However, when there is bad layer adhesion, these layers may separate.

## The layer height is too large

For good layer adhesion, the nozzle needs to slightly compress the filament. However, small nozzles, although allow for more detailed prints, suffers from limited layer heights. The general rule of thumb is that the layer height should be 80% or less of the nozzle diameter. **Try reducing the layer height**.

## The extruder temperature is too low

If the filament is too cold, the filament-to-filament bond will suffer. **Try increasing the extruder temperature** to see if the issue improves.
