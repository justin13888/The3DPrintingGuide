# Top Layer Gaps

Most parts are printed with partially hollow infill while the outer perimeters are solid. However, sometimes, there may be gaps at the top of the print.

## Too little top solid layers

**Adjust the number of top solid layers**. When printing solid layers on top of the partially hollow infill, the bridging across the hollow sections of the infill has a tendency to droop. Thus, it is generally better to print several solid layers to ensure a nice and solid top surface.

## The infill is too low

If the infill is too sparse, the large gaps may cause the top solid layers to droop. So you may have to **increase the infill percentage**.

## Under-Extrusion

If increasing the number of top solid layers and infill percentage did not work, it is likely an under-extrusion problem. **Refer to the [Under-Extrusion](underextrusion.md) article**.
