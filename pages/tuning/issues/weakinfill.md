# Weak Infill

The infill inside a 3D printed part is essential to the overall strength of the model. So, weak infill, which may appear weak or stringy, will negatively affect the final print quality.

## The infill pattern is inherently weak

While some infill patterns such as Triangular and Honeycomb are naturally strong, other patterns like Rectilinear usually sacrifice some strength to reduce print time. Therefore, **try a different infill pattern** to see if the pattern is the cause.

## The infill print speed is too fast

Although the infill can typically be printed faster than other sections such as the shell, the extruder may struggle to handle the faster infill print speed. So **reduce the infill print speed** or the default print speed as a whole.

## The infill walls need to be thicker

If possible, **increase the infill extrusion width** which can vastly increase the overall part strength. Note however, it is usually preferable to increase the infill percentage before the infill extrusion width.
