# Layer Shifting

When the stepper motors of a 3D printer move to a desired location, there is a possibility for it to mess up and be misaligned, usually while print a layer, known as a layer shift.

## The printhead is moving too fast

If you print too fast, the stepper motors may struggle to keep up. A common sign is a clicking sound when the motor struggles to move to the desired position. As a solution, **reduce the print speed**.

## Other mechanical or electrical issues

If the layer shifting continues, mechanical or electrical issues may be the cause. Belts, for example, may be too loose such that it does not grip the motors or pulley properly or too tight such that it causes excess friction.

There are also numerous electrical issues, typically involving the stepper motors and their stepper drivers. If there is inadequate current to the motor, it will not have enough power to spin. If the motor drivers overheat, it can cause the motors to stop spinning. The list continues on so do your research and see if there are issues of your specific printer or printer part.
