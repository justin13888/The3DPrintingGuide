# Bad Bed Adhesion

Bed adhesion is one of the keys to a successful print. There are numerous reasons for bad bed or first layer adhesion.

## The bed is unlevel

If the print bed is unlevel, one side of the bed may be too close to the nozzle while another may be too far. So **make sure the bed is level**.

## The nozzle is too far from the bed

Even if the bed is leveled, the nozzle may be starting too far from the build plate. Ideally, the filament should be slightly squished on the build plate. To fix, **adjust the Z offset through the firmware or slicer settings**.

## The first layer speed is too fast

To ensure that the plastic properly adheres to the build plate, it takes time for it to bond to the bed properly. So it may be necessary to **print the first layer at a slower speed**.

## The extruded filament is cooling down too fast

At plastic cools, it tends to shrink which differs from filament to filament. This means that printed parts tend to shrink and separate from the print bed as it cools. To compensate, **use a heated bed to prevent the first layer from cooling**. You can also consider disabling the part cooling fan on the first few layers. A windy environment also affects the final print and therefore, needs insulation for the printer.

## The build surface is unsuitable

Different plastics adhere to certain materials better. So **try using a build surface well-suited for the material**. Cleaning the bed with water or isopropyl alcohol may also help adhesion.

## The print does not have enough surface area on the bed

Sometimes, certain prints or designs are difficult to have good bed adhesion. If none of the above worked, **use a brim or raft** to increase the bed contact.
