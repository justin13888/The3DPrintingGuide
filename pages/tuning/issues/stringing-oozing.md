# Stringing or Oozing

Stringing or oozing occurs when there are small strands of filament left behind.

## Incorrect retraction distance

The retraction distance determines how much filament is retracted back into the nozzle. Most direct-drive extruders require 0.5-2.0 mm of retraction while some Bowden extruders require as much as 15 mm, due to the less confined filament path.

## Bad retraction speed

The retraction speed determines how fast the filament is retracted. If the retraction is too slow, the filament will slowly ooze out of the nozzle. If the retraction is too quick, the melted filament may be pulled a part from the solid filament. **Adjust the retraction speed** so the printer performs best (for the specific filament).

## The extruder temperature is too high

If the extruder temperature is set too high, the plastic filament may leak out of the nozzle more easily. On the other hand, if the temperature is too low, the plastic may struggle to extrude and retract.

## Long extruder travel distances

During long extruder travel distances, the filament has much more time to ooze out of the nozzle. Although this issue can be reduced or mitigated through a better confined filament path, it will never be perfect. Luckily, some slicers have the option to reduce the travel distance of multi-part prints. Alternatively, you can increase the XY travel speed to minimize the amount of time the extruder travels.
