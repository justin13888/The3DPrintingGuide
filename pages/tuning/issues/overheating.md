# Overheating

3D printers must precisely heat filament exiting the extruder but also cool it, at least to a certain degree, to retain its desired shape. However, the print may overheat if the balance is incorrect which can cause issues in the print.

## The part cooling is insufficient

When there is insufficient part cooling, the print cannot cool fast enough. For many filament materials, part cooling is paramount for print quality. You can **increase part cooling** such as increasing the cooling fan speed (if possible), install better part cooling (e.g. fans, fan ducts) and using an external fan to cool.

## The extruder temperature is too high

Whether the part cooling fan is inadequate or not, you can try printing at a lower extruder temperature to allow the filament to solidify faster while not under-heating the filament such that it is difficult to extrude.

## The print speed is too high

If the extruder travels and extrudes the filament too quickly, the part cooling may struggle or even fail to cool the hot filament. So **slow down the print speed** or **improve part cooling**.

## Final solution

If all else fails, print multiple parts at the same time to allow other parts cool down while printing multiple parts.
