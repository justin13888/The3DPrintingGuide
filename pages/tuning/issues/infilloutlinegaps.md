# Gaps Between Infill and Outline

While printing each layer, the outlines are usually printed first, followed by the infill. While the infill is supposed to be contacting the outline to ensure proper bonding, there can be small gaps between them.

## Not enough outline overlap

Most slicers have a settings that adjusts how much the infill and perimeter overlaps. In Cura, for example, it is called "Infill Overlap Percentage" (can be different in the future). **Try increasing the outline overlap** to see if the gap disappears.

## Printing too fast

If the infill is printing too fast, there may not be enough time for it to properly bond with the outline. **Try decreasing the print speed**.
