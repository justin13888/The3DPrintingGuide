# The 3D Printing Guide

This is a quick guide, made to help enthusiasts, makers and alike, to build, improve, fix or understand FDM (fused deposition modeling), or FFF (fused filament fabrication), printers. The goal is to introduce and cover essential topics on 3D printers as a whole. Benefits of creating a consolidated guide of general essential knowledge of 3D printers include:

- All the information is in one location.
- Information is organized in the most straightforward and concise way.
- For beginners, you can quickly learn much of the expertise and details to excel in 3D printing.
- For the curious, you can learn how to build, improve, and fix 3D printers.

Feel free to make any contributions as they are greatly appreciated. 3D printing technology is constantly improving and becoming more accessible as older technologies are scaled up for the consumer market and old patents expire which allows for personal use. So making sure this guide is up-to-date and correct also makes sure it will stay relevant and reliable.

## Chapter Overview
