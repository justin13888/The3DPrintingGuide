# The 3D Printing Guide

This is an unbiased guide, made to help enthusiasts, makers and others, to build, improve, fix or understand solely the most common type of desktop 3D printer, Cartesian fused deposition modeling (FDM), or fused filament fabrication (FFF), printers. Think of it as a handy cheat sheet that is concise and has most information you care about.

Also, feel free to make any contributions. They are greatly appreciated.
